# group-4-system-project webapp

## About
Hi there, for my 3rd year project I took the opportunity to learn golang and javascript and build
a full stack web app! I went from knowing nothing about web technologies to this app you see before you.
I'm looking forward to improving upon it and using it as a base to learn more about backend development

## Roadmap
There's loads of things I still want to do with this app:
* Unit-testing! should have started with this but I had to prioritise speed this time
* Rendering pages server side using a templating engine - far too much repeating code in html
* A database to store accounts
* Secure authentication
